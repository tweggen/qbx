## 01_BUILD_SYSTEM_MODERNIZATION.md

- **Date:** 2026-05-30
- **Status:** Phase 1 complete (CMake infrastructure). Phases 2–5 pending.
- **Verified on platform:** Windows 11 — `cmake -G Ninja` configure step
  succeeds end-to-end against Qt 6.11.1 (`C:\Qt\6.11.1\mingw_64`) using the
  bundled MinGW 13.1 + Ninja 1.12 toolchain. Build fails at compile time, as
  expected, because of Phase 2 portability work (see below). Linux/macOS
  configure not yet exercised.

### What landed

| File                                        | Purpose                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `smaragd/CMakeLists.txt`                    | Top-level project: C++17, Qt5 find_package, platform detection, audio-backend options.   |
| `smaragd/tw303a/CMakeLists.txt`             | Static `tw303a` library; per-platform backend wiring (ALSA, WASAPI, CoreAudio, etc.).    |
| `smaragd/main/CMakeLists.txt`               | `smaragd` executable; platform-appropriate target type (WIN32 / MACOSX_BUNDLE / ELF).    |
| `docs/BUILD.md`                             | Per-platform build instructions.                                                         |
| `.gitignore`                                | Added CMake / qmake build-output and IDE patterns.                                       |

### What was deliberately deferred

- **Phase 2 — audio abstraction layer.** `tw303a/src/twspeaker.cc` still
  unconditionally includes Linux POSIX headers (`unistd.h`, `sys/ioctl.h`,
  `syslog.h`) and contains the deprecated pre-10.5 CoreAudio code path. The
  CMake will configure on macOS/Windows but compilation will fail there until
  the `AudioBackend` interface and concrete backends land. ALSA Linux builds
  should continue to work unchanged.
- **Phase 3 / 4 — build variants & dep management.** The CMake supports
  multi-backend selection via `-DENABLE_*` flags and uses `find_package` /
  `pkg_check_modules` for native deps; no Conan/vcpkg integration was added.
- **Phase 5 — IDE integration.** No `.vscode/`, no Xcode/VS solution
  generators wired into helper scripts. The instructions in `docs/BUILD.md`
  cover the standard `cmake -G` invocations.
- **CI.** No GitHub Actions workflows were added (deliverable was listed as
  DevOps-owned in the original plan).
- **qmake removal.** Both build systems coexist as the original migration path
  specified. `smaragd.pro` and `smaragd/build` remain.

### Verification status

**Windows / Qt6 / MinGW — configure:** ✅ Succeeds.

```
cmake -S smaragd -B smaragd/build -G Ninja `
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.11.1/mingw_64"
```

CMake auto-detects Qt 6.11.1, sets `QT_VERSION_MAJOR=6`, picks the WASAPI
backend (placeholder), and writes a Ninja build. AUTOMOC, AUTORCC, AUTOUIC
all initialise cleanly. No warnings about missing modules.

**Windows / Qt6 / MinGW — build:** ❌ Fails at compile time. Expected. The
following files in `tw303a/src/` `#include` Linux-only POSIX headers
unconditionally:

| File                  | Offending include              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| `twmixer.cc`          | `<syslog.h>`                   |
| `twlatch.cc`          | `<syslog.h>`                   |
| `twpipe.cc`           | `<syslog.h>`                   |
| `twsimplesaw.cc`      | `<syslog.h>`                   |
| `twspeaker.cc`        | `<sys/ioctl.h>`, `<unistd.h>`, `<syslog.h>` |
| `twconstant.cc`       | `<syslog.h>`                   |
| `twcomponent.cc`      | `<syslog.h>`                   |
| (likely more)         | (build stops at first failures)|

These are the Phase 2 work-items; the CMake itself is fine.

**Sanity checks (manual):**

- All 21 `.cc` sources in `tw303a/src/` (including `twlatch.cc` and
  `twstreaminglatch.cc`, which live in src but are not declared in the
  `HEADERS` of the .pro file) are listed.
- All 22 `.cpp` sources in `main/src/` are listed.
- All headers with `Q_OBJECT` are included in target source lists so AUTOMOC
  will pick them up (verified: 7 in `tw303a/include`, 19 in `main/include`).
- Include directories match the qmake `INCLUDEPATH`:
  `include`, `main/include`, `tw303a/include`.
- ALSA compile definition (`QBX_LINUX_ALSA=1`) and link (`asound`) match the
  qmake `.pro`.

**Linux / macOS:** Configure not exercised. Should work given the same CMake
runs on the more restrictive Windows path, but should be confirmed.

### Next actions

1. **Linux smoke build.** Confirm `cd smaragd && cmake -B build &&
   cmake --build build` produces a working binary on a Linux box — the
   existing source is Linux-shaped, so this should work end-to-end and is a
   prerequisite for trusting the CMake migration.
2. **Phase 2 (audio abstraction).** Replace the platform `#ifdef` sprawl in
   `tw303a/src/twspeaker.cc` (and the `<syslog.h>` calls scattered through
   the engine) with a portable logging shim plus an `AudioBackend`
   interface. Backend `.cc` files drop into `tw303a/src/audio/` and wire
   into the existing `if(ENABLE_*)` blocks in
   `smaragd/tw303a/CMakeLists.txt`. See `plan/proposed/02_AUDIO_DRIVER_STRATEGY.md`.
3. Once Phase 2 lands, re-run the Windows build (CMake configure is already
   green) and add macOS.
4. Add a CI workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) once at least Linux is
   green end-to-end.

### Risks / unknowns

- **MOC paths.** Several `Q_OBJECT` headers (e.g. `tw303a/include/twspeaker.h`)
  pull in optional platform headers via `#ifdef`. AUTOMOC parses headers
  without those defines visible; if a `Q_OBJECT` class's signal/slot signature
  depends on a platform-only type, AUTOMOC may fail to generate a working
  moc file. Hasn't been observed, but worth watching during first build.
- **`twlatch.cc` / `twstreaminglatch.cc`.** Present on disk but missing from
  `smaragd.pro`'s `SOURCES`. Included here on the assumption they are needed —
  the qmake build may have been omitting them by mistake, or they may be
  unused. Confirm during first Linux build.
- **Qt 5 EOL.** Qt 5.15 LTS reaches end of free support in 2026. A follow-up
  proposal for Qt 6 migration may be worthwhile.
