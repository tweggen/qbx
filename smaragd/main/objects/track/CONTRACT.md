# app/objects/track — CONTRACT

Purpose: the track object. STrack (bus mixers, clip synchronization to
twTrackMix, MapPosFn wiring), its renderers, strackpath (path resolution
used by ALL placement actions), and track/placement actions: add/remove/
move/reparent/restore-track, set-track-volume, move-clip, remove-clip.

Public headers: app/objects/track/*.h

Depends on (engine): tw/core, tw/graph, tw/mix, tw/plugins. App edges: per
tools/check_layering.py.

Invariants (normative detail: CLIP_MODEL.md):
1. Clips are keyed by SLink* in every insertClip/updateClip/removeClip —
   never by component.
2. Every insertClip passes the mapPosFn
   (child.getSObject().mapTimelineToComponentPos) — a clip inserted without
   it plays from source position 0.
3. trackChildDurationChanged: sender() is the SObject — resolve links by
   scanning childLinks(); update EVERY link referencing the sender.
4. trackChildWasMoved: sender() IS the SLink (startTimeChanged is a link
   signal).
5. strackpath resolution: comma-separated child indices from the root
   mixer; reparent guards against self/descendant cycles.

6. A track's plugin chain is referenced by the ATTRIBUTE pluginChainId, and
   adopted LATE (proposal 08 M4). SPluginChain is not an SLink child of the
   track — SObject::childEvent treats every child link as a clip placement — so
   the reference cannot use the loader's <SLink objectId> ordering and STrack
   registers a SProjectLoader::deferResolve() lambda instead, which runs when
   the object dictionary is complete. adoptPluginChain() then does what a
   loaded chain's slotInserted signals never could (they were emitted while the
   chain had no owner): bus count on every slot FIRST — it selects the
   channel-mismatch mapping — then one tap per bus appended to that bus's
   twPluginChain in slot order.
7. STrack holds an SLink REFERENCE to its chain (cpPluginChainRef_), for the
   constructor-made chain as much as an adopted one. An SObject whose refcount
   reaches zero deleteLater()s itself, and the loader's temporary handle links
   die in ~SProjectLoader — so without a reference of our own an adopted chain
   would be destroyed moments after adoption. Holding one in BOTH paths also
   keeps nRefs (a serialized attribute) identical between a new and a loaded
   project, which is what lets a save/load/save comparison be byte-equivalent.
   Dropping the old reference is also what retires the empty chain the
   constructor made.
8. A slot's wire schema is descriptor_ VERBATIM, never effective_
   (spluginslot.cpp). effective_ carries the registry's resolved module path;
   serializing it would silently absolutize a relative path and make the
   project machine-specific. SPluginSlot::serializeSelfAttributes calls
   SObject::serializeSelfAttributes FIRST — that is what emits id=, and without
   it SProjectLoader::createObjects aborts the WHOLE load.

Self-registration (Phase 5): strack.cpp registers "STrack" and
spluginslot.cpp registers "SPluginSlot" with SProjectLoader from a static
initializer (spluginchain.cpp registers "SPluginChain").

How to test: render_split_slip_offset.qxa (move-clip across tracks +
removeClip), render_sawtooth_with_effects.qxa (reparent),
test_track_*.qxa (UI), plugin_slot_roundtrip.qxa + plugin_missing_placeholder.qxa
(the slot/chain round trip and the missing-plugin placeholder).

Known debt: strackpath being here forces objects/track edges from every
action slice — a path-resolution service extraction is a Phase 6 candidate.
