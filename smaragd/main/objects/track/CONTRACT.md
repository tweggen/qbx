# app/objects/track — CONTRACT

Purpose: the track object. STrack (bus mixers, clip synchronization to
twTrackMix, MapPosFn wiring), its renderers, strackpath (path resolution
used by ALL placement actions), and track/placement actions: add/remove/
move/reparent/restore-track, set-track-volume, move-clip, remove-clip.

Public headers: app/objects/track/*.h

Depends on (engine): tw/core, tw/graph, tw/mix, tw/plugins, tw/events. App
edges: per tools/check_layering.py. NOT app/objects/midi, deliberately: the
track consults MIDI-ness only through SObject::contentKind() and
SObject::resolveEventClip() (proposal 37 3.5).

Invariants (normative detail: CLIP_MODEL.md):
1. Clips are keyed by SLink* in every insertClip/updateClip/removeClip —
   never by component.
2. Every insertClip passes the mapPosFn
   (child.getSObject().mapTimelineToComponentPos) — a clip inserted without
   it plays from source position 0.
3. trackChildDurationChanged: sender() is the SObject — resolve links by
   scanning childLinks(); update EVERY link referencing the sender.
4. trackChildWasMoved: sender() IS the SLink (startTimeChanged is a link
   signal).
5. strackpath resolution: comma-separated child indices from the root
   mixer; reparent guards against self/descendant cycles.

5b. EVENT CHILDREN GO INTO THE EVENT CLIP SET, NOT THE BUS MIXERS (proposal
   36 3.2). A child whose contentKind() is Event is inserted into the track's
   ONE twEventClipSet - same slots, same SLink* key rule as the mixers, but one
   set per track rather than one per bus, because events are not per bus. It is
   never inserted as a ClipEntry: a MIDI clip has no page to freeze, and doing
   so would cost a dummy freeze per page per clip plus a twView warning per
   freeze (fact M5/F12). The resolver is the generic
   SObject::resolveEventClip(), resolved ONCE per collect at the window start -
   the same coherence rule twView::resolve gives the audio path.
   Every event edit invalidates [a, INFINITY): the consumer of an event stream
   is class-1 (a synth voice carries state across pages), so a change at one
   position can
   be heard at any later one (F9). The app-side walk is the ONLY path that
   carries a clip change up to the root (F13), so touchClip alone is not enough
   - invalidateRenderPathRange must follow it.

5c. THE FEED IS REBUILT ON EVERY READ (3.2.1). STrack::eventFeed() is a stable
   twEventMerge object whose SOURCE LIST is recomputed per call: its own clip
   set plus the feed of every child track that bubbles events up (no instrument
   slot and no MIDI-out, unless the serialized midiRouting says otherwise), with
   muted and solo-excluded children contributing nothing under the shared
   ssolorules.h resolution. Rebuilding rather than dirty-flagging is deliberate:
   SOLO IS GLOBAL, so a flag would have to be poked from anywhere in the
   project, which is exactly the coupling ssolorules.h exists to avoid. The
   merge object identity is stable, so a consumer may hold it.

6. A track's plugin chain is referenced by the ATTRIBUTE pluginChainId, and
   adopted LATE (proposal 08 M4). SPluginChain is not an SLink child of the
   track — SObject::childEvent treats every child link as a clip placement — so
   the reference cannot use the loader's <SLink objectId> ordering and STrack
   registers a SProjectLoader::deferResolve() lambda instead, which runs when
   the object dictionary is complete. adoptPluginChain() then does what a
   loaded chain's slotInserted signals never could (they were emitted while the
   chain had no owner): bus count on every slot FIRST — it selects the
   channel-mismatch mapping — then one tap per bus appended to that bus's
   twPluginChain in slot order.
7. STrack holds an SLink REFERENCE to its chain (cpPluginChainRef_), for the
   constructor-made chain as much as an adopted one. An SObject whose refcount
   reaches zero deleteLater()s itself, and the loader's temporary handle links
   die in ~SProjectLoader — so without a reference of our own an adopted chain
   would be destroyed moments after adoption. Holding one in BOTH paths also
   keeps nRefs (a serialized attribute) identical between a new and a loaded
   project, which is what lets a save/load/save comparison be byte-equivalent.
   Dropping the old reference is also what retires the empty chain the
   constructor made.
8. A slot's wire schema is descriptor_ VERBATIM, never effective_
   (spluginslot.cpp). effective_ carries the registry's resolved module path;
   serializing it would silently absolutize a relative path and make the
   project machine-specific. SPluginSlot::serializeSelfAttributes calls
   SObject::serializeSelfAttributes FIRST — that is what emits id=, and without
   it SProjectLoader::createObjects aborts the WHOLE load.
9. MIDI output (proposal 37 P7b) is three serialized attributes and nothing
   more: `midiOutPort` is a PORTABLE device NAME (never a machine-local id —
   `SSettings` maps the name to a WinMM index / CoreMIDI uniqueID / ALSA
   "client:port" per machine, the same split the audio output device uses),
   `midiOutChannel` is 0-BASED 0..15 with -1 meaning "as authored", and
   `midiOutOffsetMs` is a signed +-500 ms send offset where POSITIVE means SEND
   EARLIER. All three are written ONLY when they are not the default, so every
   project written before proposal 37 re-serializes byte-identically. The track
   itself opens no port and sends nothing: `SMidiOutPump` (main/shell) reads
   `hasMidiOut()` and the feed.
10. hasMidiOut() feeds `bubblesEventsUp()`, so GAINING OR LOSING A PORT changes
   the `auto` routing rule ("consumed here, or bubbled up") and therefore what
   the PARENT's feed — and its instrument — receives. `setMidiOutput` range-
   invalidates `[0, inf)` on that transition and only on it; a channel or
   offset change moves no audio and invalidates nothing.

Self-registration (Phase 5): strack.cpp registers "STrack" and
spluginslot.cpp registers "SPluginSlot" with SProjectLoader from a static
initializer (spluginchain.cpp registers "SPluginChain").

How to test: render_split_slip_offset.qxa (move-clip across tracks +
removeClip), render_sawtooth_with_effects.qxa (reparent),
test_track_*.qxa (UI), plugin_slot_roundtrip.qxa + plugin_missing_placeholder.qxa
(the slot/chain round trip and the missing-plugin placeholder).

Known debt: strackpath being here forces objects/track edges from every
action slice — a path-resolution service extraction is a Phase 6 candidate.
