# app/model — CONTRACT

Purpose: the document model core. SObject (the tree node: properties,
ordered SLink children, aspect page cache, IRevalidatable implementation),
SLink (placement: parent + startTime), SProject (root, sample rate,
channel count, settings, revalidator), extern-file bookkeeping, and the SObjectRenderer
interface views implement.

Public headers: app/model/{sobject,slink,sproject,sprojectprops,
ssortedobjlist,sexternfile,sexternfilelist,sfilepathref,sobjectrenderer}.h

Depends on (engine): tw/core, tw/graph, tw/pages, tw/schedule, tw/sources.
App edges: NONE — the model names no concrete object types (Phase 5) and
hosts the Phase 6 decoupling seams: sappcontext.h (the ONLY way core
modules reach the application), sdetaileditors.h (view-widget factory),
sobjectpath.h (generic index-path helpers; SObject::isPathContainer scopes
the reverse search exactly as the old STrack cast did), and splacements.h
(the placement service: rootContainer/laneAt/placementAt — the generic
resolution+validation that action code uses instead of STrack/SStdMixer
casts; lane-ness is isPathContainer, the active lane is activeLane, and
volumeDbSnapshot gives renderers a thread-safe volume read).
Dependency invalidation goes through the virtual
SObject::invalidateAspects() (base no-op, SCut overrides); extern-file
creation goes through SProject::registerExternFileFactory() (the wave slice
registers its WAV loader from a static initializer).

Threading: SObject follows THREADING.md rule 2 (mutex per object, snapshot
reads, atomic currentPage_); the revalidator calls the reval* delegations.
The reval pin (revalAddRef/revalRemoveRef) is a separate std::atomic —
NEVER the Qt refcount, which is main-thread-only (asserted): routing pins
through addRef()/removeRef() raced the non-atomic nRefs_ from the worker
pool and a premature deleteLater() destroyed objects that live SLinks still
referenced (the split-then-repaint vtable-garbage crash).

Invariants:
1. ~SLink must setParent(nullptr) BEFORE the vtable is torn down (childEvent
   during destruction was a use-after-destruction freeze).
2. childLinks()/childAt() are the ordered view — never iterate QObject
   children() where order matters.
3. mapTimelineToComponentPos() is identity here; only windowed objects
   (SCut) override it (POSITION_DOMAINS.md rule 3).
4. Every user-visible mutation flows through an SAction — no direct model
   pokes from views.
5. durationChanged is emitted by the OBJECT; startTimeChanged by the LINK
   (CLIP_MODEL.md — sender types differ and it matters).
6. An SLink is owned by exactly one container — its QObject parent; nothing
   adopts a caller's link (SCut builds its OWN content link from the
   SObject&; callers delete their temporary AFTER the cut exists). A parent
   must never reach the SLink QObject constructor — both ctors attach via
   setParent() as their last step, and SObject::childEvent qobject_casts
   (a non-SLink child of an SObject is ignored, never type-confused into
   childOrder_).
7. An external file reference is PORTABLE ON DISK and ABSOLUTE IN MEMORY.
   SFilePathRef::toStored/fromStored are the only encoders, and they pick
   project-relative first, "~/..." when the climb lands exactly on the home
   directory, absolute only when it goes past home to a root (sfilepathref.h
   explains why each). The anchor is SProject::projectFilePath(), which the
   save/load actions maintain — never the serialized fileName attribute.
   Nothing in the model ever hands a stored spelling to a file API, and
   nothing hands an absolute path to a serializer.
8. addRef()/removeRef() are main-thread-only (asserted). removeRef()'s
   deleteLater() is re-checked in SObject::event(): a re-referenced
   (1→0→1) or reval-pinned object swallows the stale DeferredDelete (the
   last unpin re-arms it via deletePending_), and ~SObject warns if it ever
   runs with live references.
9. The preview NEVER moves a live play cursor. A sample-backed object reads
   its twRandomSource statelessly; a CONTAINER (no random source) reads its
   root component's FROZEN PAGES — requestPage() at FRAME_CAPACITY
   granularity, each page chained into the next as previousPage
   (FREEZE_PROTOCOL.md "Sequential consumers"). The retired spelling —
   seek() + calcOutputTo() per preview window — wrote a cursor an in-flight
   freeze on another thread was about to read (the exact race
   twComponent::seek()'s detector was installed for), from the paint path.
   One probe means the same thing either way: the signed min/max envelope
   of its previewSkip_ window, scaled to [-128,127].

10. SProject::channels() is PROJECT DATA AND NOTHING ELSE (proposal 36 M1).
   It persists as <SProject channels='N'>, takes only 1/2/4/6/8, and reads
   with the sampleRate warn-and-default idiom: missing (a legacy file) or
   unsupported means 2 — today's audible width — plus exactly one warning,
   because a wrong channel count corrupts a project as thoroughly as a wrong
   rate, and because a project must never fail to OPEN over it. Nothing
   connects it to a bus count, a mixer width or tw303aEnvironment: an undo of
   6 -> 2 that reached STrack::setNBusses would hit the shrink
   Q_ASSERT_X( false, ... ). The signal flow goes wide in proposal 36 B4/B5,
   and only then does this become a consequence.

How to test: full qxa suite; action_roundtrip_test for serialization
adjacency; filepathref_test (ctest) for the three path-storage rules and
sample_path_portable.qxa for the save -> reload -> render wiring;
project_channels_test (ctest) for invariant 10 — including the assertion
that set-project-channels and its undo make ZERO STrack::setNBusses calls,
which is instrumented rather than reviewed because it is a negative;
preview_container_test (ctest) for invariant 9 — probe values across page
boundaries, one reset for four pages, one reposition per page.

Known debt: none of the former model→objects edges remain; the module is
ready to become a real build target once its remaining consumers are.
